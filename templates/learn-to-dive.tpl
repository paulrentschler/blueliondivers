    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Scuba diving is a self-regulated industry. That means that 
        there are no laws requiring scuba certification in order 
        for you to scuba dive, but everyone in the scuba industry
        has gotten together and agreed on a minimum set of standards
        that everyone must meet in order to be qualified to scuba
        dive safely. Certifying agencies setup courses to teach
        these minimum standards (and typically more) to people who
        want to scuba dive. Upon successful demonstration of these
        skills a certifying agency issues a certification card to
        the student which then allows them to purchase scuba diving
        equipment, get air fills, and get aboard dive boats.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most entry level scuba diving courses are divided into
        three parts: academic learning, pool practice, and open
        water demonstration. Typically the academic and pool practice
        are combined into one course and the open water demonstration
        or certification dives are offered separately. This is done
        because not everyone wants to do their open water dives in
        the quarries of central Pennsylvania. Once you successfully
        complete the academic and pool portions of the course, you
        can obtain a referral from your instructor to go anywhere
        in the world to do your open water dives.

    <h2>Where can I take a course?</h2>
    <p>
        Blue Lion SCUBA Club does not offer beginner "learn to dive"
        courses, but our local dives shops
        <a href="http://divestsc.com">Sunken Treasure Scuba Center</a>
        and <a href="http://www.rcscuba.net">R & C Scuba</a> have
        courses starting all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are a Penn State student, faculty or staff member you can
        learn to scuba dive through the KINES 45 course or in the
        evenings through the
        <a href="http://www.athletics.psu.edu/advrec/scuba.html">Adventure
        Recreation program</a>.

    <h2>Common Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>Do I need to own my own equipment?</h3>
    <p>
        Typically the only equipment you need to purchase is a scuba mask,
        snorkel, boots, and fins. Cost depends on the brand and style of
        each item you select but average cost is around $200.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your taking either of the Penn State courses, you do not need
        to purchase anything.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Do I need to be able to swim?</h3>
    <p>
        You don't have to be an olympic-class swimmer, but basic swimming
        ability and comfort in the water are key necessities for a
        successful scuba course.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every dive shop/instructor has different requirements for swimming
        proficiency, it's best to check with them for exact details.
    </p>
    
    <h3>I have a medical condition, can I still learn to scuba dive?</h3>
    <p>
        Maybe. Some medical conditions preclude a person from safely
        scuba diving. This determination can only be made by your scuba
        instructor in conjunction with your physician. A medical assessment
        is done as part of the course and you may be required to obtain a
        physician's approval before taking the course.

        <a href="http://www.diversalertnetwork.org/medical/faq/">common 
        medical conditions and how they relate to scuba diving</a> on the
        Divers Alert Network website. Divers Alert Network is the premier
        diving medicine research and emergency assistance service for scuba divers.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How long is my scuba certification good for?</h3>
    <p>
        Your certification is good for life. It is recommended that if you
        have not dove in a year or more that you obtain a refresher before
        doing dives on your own. This allows you to refresh your academic
        knowledge and scuba skills before going back into open water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Blue Lion SCUBA Club does refreshers upon request, 
        <a href="/contact.php">contact us</a> to arrange one.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What are the names of these certifying agencies?</h3>
    <p>
        There are quite a few scuba certifying agencies worldwide.
        In the United States the three biggest agencies are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.naui.org">NAUI
                    - National Association of Underwater Instructors</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.padi.com">PADI
                    - Professional Association of Diving Instructors</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.divessi.com/">SSI
                    - Scuba Schools International</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        No one agency is particularly better than another; they all have
        their good and bad points. It is more important to pick a
        course based on the quality of the instructor than the
        agency they teach for.
