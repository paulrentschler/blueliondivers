    <h3>Dive site description</h3>
    <p>
        Bonne Terre mine is a former lead mine converted to a dive site. It is
        illuminated with over 500,000 watts of lighting from above the water;
        thus divers are <strong>not allowed to carry dive lights or knives</strong>.
        The mine also provides ideal, year round conditions of
        <strong>60 degree water</strong> temperatures with no thermoclines and
        <strong>65 degree air</strong> temperatures, not to mention the
        <strong>100 foot of visibility</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <strong>7mm wetsuit and hood</strong> are required for diving the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        All dives are limited to 12 divers and lead by two dive guides. There are
        50 different "trails" through the mine and you dive them in order. Each
        dive is about <strong>35-45 minutes</strong> long and depths are around
        <strong>40-60 feet</strong>.
