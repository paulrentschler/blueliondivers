        In 1967 a small group of students started the first Penn State
        Scuba Club on the University Park campus which ultimately became
        know as <a href="http://www.nittanydivers.org">Nittany Divers</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nittany Divers continues to be a student-run scuba club at
        Penn State today but due to some policy changes in Fall 2012
        the membership has changed. Up until then students, faculty, staff,
        alumni, and community members all socialized and dove together in a
        thriving club. The Fall 2012 policy changes restricted membership
        to currently enrolled students in addition to faculty and staff
        members only. The State College community members and alumni
        were abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
        What were these abandoned divers to do, but start a new club!
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus Blue Lion SCUBA Club was born and we exist to provide a club
        to allow the State College-area divers and any Penn State/Nittany
        Diver alumni a place to socialize and go diving. Read more about
        <a href="/about.php">our history</a>.

    <p>
        Our current focus is currently on local (central and
        eastern Pennsylvania) diving, but the plan is to eventually
        organizing more "exotic" dive trips that will give Penn State
        Alumni from far and wide an opportunity to come together and
        share some great diving experiences. Exotic destinations currently
        under consideration include:
        <ul>
          <li>St Lucia, West Indies</li>
          <li>Roatan, Honduras</li>
          <li>Playa Del Carmen, Mexico</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
