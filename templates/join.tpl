    <h2>Email list</h2>
    <p>
        Everyone is encouraged to join the email list to be notified about
        upcoming dive and social events along with other dive-related
        information that might come along. Not everyone is on Facebook and
        not everything is easily posted to our Facebook group, so the email
        list is the best way to ensure you don't miss anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        To join, send a blank email to: <a href="mailto:blue-lion-scuba+subscribe@googlegroups.com"
        >blue-lion-scuba+subscribe@googlegroups.com</a>

    <p>
        For those interested, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bluelionscuba/">Facebook
        group</a> is maintained for the club. Please feel free to join in on
        the conversations and event planning.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recognize that not everyone wants to be part of Facebook so every
        effort is made to ensure that the information posted to our Facebook
        group is also shared via our email list.
