        Facilitating diving activities and social events for scuba divers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Blue Lion SCUBA Club exists to provide a way for scuba divers
        interested in scuba diving to associate with each other and most
        importantly go diving together. Our membership is focused on Penn
        State/Nittany Diver alumni and State College area divers but anyone
        is welcome to be a part of our group.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of our diving is in the lakes and quarries of central and
        eastern Pennsylvania, but opportunities to travel to more interesting
        destinations exist as well.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Formed by Paul Rentschler in the spring of 2012, Blue Lion SCUBA Club
        started out as little more than a Facebook group. It's main goal was
        to provide a way for a group of friends to plan and coordinate scuba
        diving outings to local quarries.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Fall 2012 policy changes at Penn State University left the State
        College community members and Penn State Alumni who use to be a part
        of the Penn State Nittany Divers without a dive club to call home.
        Blue Lion SCUBA Club stepped in to provide a new home to these
        great divers.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the winter of 2012, the club expanded to include an email list and
        a temporary website with a complete list of planned events for 2013.
    </p>
    <p>
        The name is borrowed from from a previous State College-based dive
        shop named Blue Lion SCUBA which was owned and operated by Ann
        Sullivan. Ann is a member of the club and is happy to see the name
        live on.
