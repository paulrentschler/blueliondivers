        <h2>Calling all divers!</h2>
        <p>
          Come socialize with other State College-area divers. Swap dive tales,
          get gear advise, and find new dive/travel buddies.
        <p>
          Most of our events
          revolve around going diving, but we also have a good number of
          social events.
