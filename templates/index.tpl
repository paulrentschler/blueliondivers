          <p>
            Certified scuba divers and non-divers are welcome.

            Most of our events
            revolve around going diving, but we do have social events which tend
            to be of greater interest to our land-bound friends.

        <div class="span4">
          <h2>Where</h2>
          <p>
            Most of us are based in the State College, PA area but that is not a
            requirement as we have members from all over.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: most dives are planned in the central and eastern Pennsylvania
            areas.

        <div class="span4">
          <h2>Why</h2>
          <p>
            Many of us are alumni members of the
            <a href="http://www.nittanydivers.org">Penn State Nittany Divers SCUBA club</a>
            and/or State College community members who wanted to stay in touch and keep
            diving.
