<h1>Upcoming Events</h1>
<p>
  As a virtual group of divers, we are all about going diving and socializing
  so we can talk about going diving.

    <h3><a href="http://www.baltimorediveshow.com/">Baltimore/D.C. Dive Show</a></h3>
    <div class="datetime">Saturday, January 26th &mdash; 8am - 10pm</div>
    <div class="location">
      <a href="http://www.sheratonbaltimorecitycenter.com/">Sheraton Baltimore City Center Hotel</a>
      &mdash; 101 West Fayette Street, Baltimore, MD 21201
    </div>
    <p>
      This is the second year for this fledgling dive show. It caters mainly
      to people looking for dive destinations but some manufacturers exhibit
      as well. It's a great excuse to socialize with other divers and check
      out some cool new dive gear and destinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will grab lunch/dinner someplace around Baltimore (probably the Inner Harbor).

    <h3>Annual Too Cold Social</h3>
    <div class="datetime">Saturday, February 23rd &mdash; 9am - 8pm</div>
    <div class="location">
      TBA &mdash; We are looking at someplace in the Philadelphia area.
    </div>
    <p>
      It's still too cold to go diving in February so lets get together for
      lunch and lots of good diving talk. Tentative host will be Matt V.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is to move the location of the social around to different
      areas particularly since some of our "distant" members travel a lot
      to dive with us. This would give us a chance to travel to them and
      return the favor.
