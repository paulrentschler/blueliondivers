          <p>
            Spend the week between Christmas and New Years in sunny Florida while diving
            on some amazing reefs and shipwrecks. A traditional trip from the early days
            of <a href="http://www.nittanydivers.org">Nittany Divers</a>, this trip has
            continued for the last 10+ years under the leadership of Jon Leslie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leave two days after Christmas for a 24-hour drive (or a much shorter plane
            flight) to the KOA Campground on Sugarloaf Key (just 3 islands back from Key
            West). December 29th and 30th are spent enjoying the underwater wonders
            of the Florida Keys. With shallow reefs and large shipwrecks there are dives
            perfect for beginners and experienced divers alike. When the diving ends,
            the partying begins as Key West comes alive for New Years Eve like no other
            place on earth! A combination of Mardi Gras and Times Square the Floridians
            of Key West ring in the new year with a style all their own!
