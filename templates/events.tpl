            to dive with us. This would give us a chance to travel to them and

            While there are lots of activities going on Blue-White weekend, they
            always seem to exclude scuba. Well, we are bound to change that. In
            it's 3rd or 4th year, we are going to continue the tradition of going
            diving the day after the Blue-White football game. So if your coming
            to town for the game, don't forget your gear and make sure you have
            that Blue Hole waiver on file early.

            attractions to explore. Many of these attractions exist in 20 feet of
            water making for an excellent dive for beginner divers and for night
            diving. Additional attractions exist in 45 feet and deeper waters.

            Guppy also has decent camping facilities and is not overly crowded at
            this time of year. We had a nice weekend camping trip here in 2012, 
            lets hope the monsoons don't come back to join us in 2013.

          <h3>Florida Keys Trip</h3>
          <div class="datetime">Thursday, December 26th &mdash; Thursday, January 2nd</div>
          <div class="location">
            Sugerloaf Key, Florida
          </div>
          <p>
            Spend the week between Christmas and New Years in Sunny Florida while diving
            on some amazing reefs and shipwrecks.  A traditional trip from the early days
            of <a href="http://www.nittanydivers.org">Nittany Divers</a>, this trip has
            continued for the last 10 years under the leadership of Jon Leslie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leave the day after Christmas for a 24 hour drive (or a much shorter plane
            flight) to the KOA Campground on Sugarloaf Key (just 3 islands back from Key
            West). December 28th, 29th, and 30th are spent enjoying the underwater wonders
            of the Florida Keys. With shallow reefs and large shipwrecks there are dives
            perfect for beginners and experienced divers alike. When the diving ends,
            the partying begins as Key West comes alive for New Years Eve like no other
            place on earth! A combination of Mardi Gras and Times Square the Floridians
            of Key West ring in the new year with a style all their own!
