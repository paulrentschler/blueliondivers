          <p>
            We generally motor around the lake, slip into little coves to hang
            out and explore. We may have a few sets of gear for poking about but
            it won't be a "15 dives in 4-days live-aboard experience". We'll
            mostly be chillin' topside.

            A long standing <a href="http://www.nittanydivers.org">Nittany

            Homecoming weekend. In recent years that tradition as faultered,
            but we are here to reinstate it better than ever!
          </p>
          <p>
            Come out and enjoy your own "bug" (lobster) cooked right before
            your very eyes. Marinade your lobster in freshly melted butter and
            enjoy it along with some tasty side dishes and cold beverages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Penn State alumni are specifically invited to attend this event
            as that's what the tradition has been about; creating an event
            to bring generations of Penn State scuba divers together!

            Spend the week between Christmas and New Years in sunny Florida while diving
            on some amazing reefs and shipwrecks. A traditional trip from the early days
            of <a href="http://www.nittanydivers.org">Nittany Divers</a>, this trip has
            continued for the last 10+ years under the leadership of Jon Leslie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leave the day after Christmas for a 24-hour drive (or a much shorter plane
            flight) to the KOA Campground on Sugarloaf Key (just 3 islands back from Key
            West). December 28th, 29th, and 30th are spent enjoying the underwater wonders
            of the Florida Keys. With shallow reefs and large shipwrecks there are dives
            perfect for beginners and experienced divers alike. When the diving ends,
            the partying begins as Key West comes alive for New Years Eve like no other
            place on earth! A combination of Mardi Gras and Times Square the Floridians
            of Key West ring in the new year with a style all their own!
